# 👋 Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile  
My journey in computer science is defined by the rigorous, self-directed curriculum at 42 Beirut and my studies at USAL University. This experience has allowed me to independently develop a strong foundation in a variety of programming areas. I'm eager to apply my problem-solving skills and connect with others in the technology community.
