### ‚ú® My Philosophy: Build, Break, Rebuild

At 42 Beirut, I honed my ability to tackle complex problems independently, embracing challenges from system programming to full-stack development. My approach is hands-on, iterative, and always seeking optimal solutions.

-   **Systems Architecture & Programming**: Deep dives into C, understanding low-level mechanics.
-   **Full Stack Development**: Crafting intuitive user interfaces and robust backends.
-   **Algorithmic Thinking**: Solving puzzles with efficient and elegant code.
-   **Continuous Exploration**: Always seeking the next challenge, from mobile to graphics.
